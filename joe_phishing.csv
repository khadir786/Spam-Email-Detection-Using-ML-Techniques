Dear valued PayPal member: 

PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of 
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs 
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud 
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your 
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your 
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your 
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This 
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not 
compromised. 

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an 
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account 
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account 
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541 

We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. 
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension. 
Please update your records on or before July 27, 2005. 

Once you have updated your account records, your PayPal session will not be 
interrupted and will continue as normal. 
To update your Paypal records click on the following link:

Dear valued PayPal member: 

PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of 
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs 
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud 
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your 
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your 
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your 
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This 
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not 
compromised. 

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an 
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account 
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account 
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541 

We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. 
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension. 
Please update your records on or before July 27, 2005. 

Once you have updated your account records, your PayPal session will not be 
interrupted and will continue as normal.

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an

understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541 

We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. 
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension.

  About NCUA 
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal agency that charters and supervises federal credit unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, operates the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) insuring the savings of 80 million account holders in all federal credit unions and many state-chartered credit unions. 
During the 1990s and into the 21st century, credit unions have been healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a healthy equity level.

The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a safe environment for over 80 million account holders in all federal credit unions and many state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the security of holders account and of the Federal Credit Unions (FCU) network is our primary concern. To protect the security of your account, NCUA employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud teams regularly scan the federal credit unions systems for unusual activity. 
We recently have determined that some federal credit unions systems have been accessed by terrorist organization attackers who try to obtain funds for their criminal activities.
Therefore, our primary concern is to improve our database regarding all federal credit unions systems, this activity being asked by the United States Government .

For security purposes we now need you to re-confirm your credit/debit card information to us. If this is not completed in 48 hours, we will be forced to suspend your account indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent and terrorist purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this manner. 
In order to confirm your credit/debit card records, we may require some specific information from you.

PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not compromised.

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we mayrequire some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-046-631-789
We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible.
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account or
may result in eventual account closure. Click here to confirm your account

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please understand that
this is a security measure meant to help protect you and your account. We
apologize for any inconvenience

� eBay Fraud Mediation Request

Dear eBay Member,
We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your eBay account from a foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used by a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by you 
The login attempt was made from: 
IP address: 66.135.192.124 
ISP Host: NS1.Ebay.NET

By now, we used many techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our users provide us when they register on the Site. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, eBay cannot and does not confirm each user's purported identity. Thus, we have established an offline verification system o help you evaluate with who you are dealing with. 

Log in your account and Verify your data

http://cgi1.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?MyEbayLogin
Please save this fraud alert ID for your reference 
Please Note -
If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice but to temporally suspend your account.

Die Deutsche Bank sorgt immer fur die Sicherheit von unseren Kunden, deswegen werden von uns immer wieder neue Methoden zur Sicherung der Interessen von unseren Klienten entwickelt. 
In der letzten Zeit wurden die Betrugereiversuche, die Geldmittel von den Bankkonten zu stehlen, haufiger geworden. Das Anwendungssystem der TAN - Aufstellung hat sich nicht ganz bewahrt. Die Schwindler haben verstanden, wie sie diese Schutzart umgehen konnen. 
Wir haben sehr sorgfaltig jeden Diebstahl von den Konten behandelt und haben somit eine Liste von den Merkmalen der verdachtigen Operation gemacht. 
Gegenwartig haben wir ein neues elektronisches Sicherheitssystem aufgebaut, das den Zugang zu den Bankkonten verhindert, das ist praktisch einsatzbereit. Scheint die Transaktion unsauber, so wird von dem System eine Geheimfrage gestellt. Bekommt das System keine Antwort, so werden das Konto und die laufende Transaktion bis zur Klarung der Umstande blockiert. 

Wir bitten Sie, um das System richtig laufen zu lassen, die Form der zusatzlichen Autorisation auszufullen. 

Wir hoffen, dass Sie unser neues Sicherheitssystem richtig einschatzen.

The message you received was not sent to you by Amazon.com.  We are 
investigating the situation and working to get that webpage removed. 
You did the right thing by contacting us.

For your protection, we suggest that you never respond to requests 
for personal information that may be contained in the forged e-
mail.  I've provided some tips below my signature to help you 
identify spoof messages.

I want to assure you that Amazon.com is not in the business of 
selling customer information.  Many spammers and spoofers use 
programs that randomly generate e-mail addresses, in the hope that 
some percentage of these randomly-generated addresses will actually 
exist.

Important Note: If you submitted your credit card number to the 
faked ""Amazon.com"" web site, we advise that you take steps to 
protect your information by notifying your credit card company.  
Additionally, you should delete that credit card from your 
Amazon.com account to prevent anyone from improperly regaining 
access to your account.  To do so, click the link in your Seller 
Account to ""Change your Amazon.com store-wide settings such as e-
mail, address book, and 1-Click.""  Then click ""Edit or delete a 
credit card"" under Payment Settings in Your Account.

Amazon.com has recently taken steps to combat e-mail forgeries such 
as this in the U.S. and Canada; you can read more about our efforts 
here:

http://www.amazon.com/stopspoofing 

I have included more information below my signature to assist you in 
identifying e-mail forgeries. If you encounter any other spoof 
messages in the future, please forward the messages to stop-
spoofing@amazon.com.

Thank you again for taking the time to contact us.

Best regards,

Amie M. 
Amazon.com Customer Service
http://www.amazon.com  
============================== 
Check your order and more: http://www.amazon.com/your-account 

1. Amazon.com will *not* ask you for the following 
   information in an e-mail message:
	* Your Amazon.com password
	* Your bank account information
	* Your credit card information or PIN
	* Your social security number
	* Your mother's maiden name or other information
          to identify you

2. Be on the lookout for poor grammar or typographical 
   errors. Many phishing e-mails are translated from 
   other languages or are sent without being proof-read.
   As a result, these messages can contain bad grammar or 
   typographical errors.

3. Check the return address-- genuine e-mails come from 
   an e-mail address ending in ""@amazon.com"".

4. Check the Web site address-- genuine Amazon.com Web 
   sites always end with "".amazon.com"" -- that is, 
   ""www.amazon.com.""  We *never* use a combination such 
   as ""security-amazon.com"" or ""amazon.com.biz"".

5. When in doubt, go directly to the Amazon.com web site. 
   Some phishing e-mails include a link that looks as though
   it will take you to your account, but it is really a 
   shortened link to a completely different Web site. If you 
   hover over the link in your e-mail client, you often can 
   see the underlying, false Web address, either as a pop-up
   or as information in the browser status bar

6. Do not ""unsubscribe""-- many spammers use these ""unsubscribe"" 
   processes to create a list of valid, working e-mail addresses.

Dear valued PayPal member: 

PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of 
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs 
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud 
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your 
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your 
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your 
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This 
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not 
compromised. 

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an 
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account 
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account 
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541 

We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. 
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension. 
Please update your records on or before July 27, 2005. 

Once you have updated your account records, your PayPal session will not be 
interrupted and will continue as normal.

Dear valued PayPal member: 

PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of 
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs 
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud 
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your 
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your 
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your 
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This 
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not 
compromised. 

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an 
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account 
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account 
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541 

We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. 
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension. 
Please update your records on or before July 27, 2005. 

Once you have updated your account records, your PayPal session will not be 
interrupted and will continue as normal. 
To update your Paypal records click on the following link:

Dear valued PayPal member: 

PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of 
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs 
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud 
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your 
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your 
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your 
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This 
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not 
compromised. 

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an 
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account 
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account 
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541 

We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. 
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension. 
Please update your records on or before July 27, 2005. 

Once you have updated your account records, your PayPal session will not be 
interrupted and will continue as normal.

Dear valued **PayPal* *member,

It has come to our attention that your *PayPal* account is being accessed by
more than one IP address. This might mean that your account is being used
by a third-party. However, it does not necessarily mean your account is
hi-jacked but at PayPal our top-most concern is security for our members.
As part of our commitment to fight against fraud, you need to verify your
information with us. You can do so by clicking the following link.

However, inability to do so might result in your account being marked as
""compromised"" and your account access will then be changed to ""Limited""

Once you have completed the process, your *PayPal* session will not be
interrupted and will continue as normal.

To continue, click on the following link:

Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you receive this message your information is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your PayPal account.

  About NCUA 
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal agency that charters and supervises federal credit unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, operates the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) insuring the savings of 80 million account holders in all federal credit unions and many state-chartered credit unions. 
During the 1990s and into the 21st century, credit unions have been healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a healthy equity level.

The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a safe environment for over 80 million account holders in all federal credit unions and many state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the security of holders account and of the Federal Credit Unions (FCU) network is our primary concern. To protect the security of your account, NCUA employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud teams regularly scan the federal credit unions systems for unusual activity. 
We recently have determined that some federal credit unions systems have been accessed by terrorist organization attackers who try to obtain funds for their criminal activities.
Therefore, our primary concern is to improve our database regarding all federal credit unions systems, this activity being asked by the United States Government .

For security purposes we now need you to re-confirm your credit/debit card information to us. If this is not completed in 48 hours, we will be forced to suspend your account indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent and terrorist purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this manner. 
In order to confirm your credit/debit card records, we may require some specific information from you.

Subject of this verification process are also the accounts that have unpaid dues to eBay.

� eBay Fraud Mediation Request

Dear eBay Member,
We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your eBay account from a foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used by a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by you 
The login attempt was made from: 
IP address: 66.135.192.124 
ISP Host: NS1.Ebay.NET

By now, we used many techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our users provide us when they register on the Site. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, eBay cannot and does not confirm each user's purported identity. Thus, we have established an offline verification system o help you evaluate with who you are dealing with. 

Log in your account and Verify your data

http://cgi1.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?MyEbayLogin
Please save this fraud alert ID for your reference 
Please Note -
If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice but to temporally suspend your account. 
* Please do not respond to this e-mail as your reply will not be received.

Die Deutsche Bank sorgt immer fur die Sicherheit von unseren Kunden, deswegen werden von uns immer wieder neue Methoden zur Sicherung der Interessen von unseren Klienten entwickelt. 
In der letzten Zeit wurden die Betrugereiversuche, die Geldmittel von den Bankkonten zu stehlen, haufiger geworden. Das Anwendungssystem der TAN - Aufstellung hat sich nicht ganz bewahrt. Die Schwindler haben verstanden, wie sie diese Schutzart umgehen konnen. 
Wir haben sehr sorgfaltig jeden Diebstahl von den Konten behandelt und haben somit eine Liste von den Merkmalen der verdachtigen Operation gemacht. 
Gegenwartig haben wir ein neues elektronisches Sicherheitssystem aufgebaut, das den Zugang zu den Bankkonten verhindert, das ist praktisch einsatzbereit. Scheint die Transaktion unsauber, so wird von dem System eine Geheimfrage gestellt. Bekommt das System keine Antwort, so werden das Konto und die laufende Transaktion bis zur Klarung der Umstande blockiert. 

Wir bitten Sie, um das System richtig laufen zu lassen, die Form der zusatzlichen Autorisation auszufullen. 

Wir hoffen, dass Sie unser neues Sicherheitssystem richtig einschatzen. 

Danke fur die Zusammenarbeit,

The message you received was not sent to you by Amazon.com.  We are 
investigating the situation and working to get that webpage removed. 
You did the right thing by contacting us.

For your protection, we suggest that you never respond to requests 
for personal information that may be contained in the forged e-
mail.  I've provided some tips below my signature to help you 
identify spoof messages.

I want to assure you that Amazon.com is not in the business of 
selling customer information.  Many spammers and spoofers use 
programs that randomly generate e-mail addresses, in the hope that 
some percentage of these randomly-generated addresses will actually 
exist.

Important Note: If you submitted your credit card number to the 
faked ""Amazon.com"" web site, we advise that you take steps to 
protect your information by notifying your credit card company.  
Additionally, you should delete that credit card from your 
Amazon.com account to prevent anyone from improperly regaining 
access to your account.  To do so, click the link in your Seller 
Account to ""Change your Amazon.com store-wide settings such as e-
mail, address book, and 1-Click.""  Then click ""Edit or delete a 
credit card"" under Payment Settings in Your Account.

Amazon.com has recently taken steps to combat e-mail forgeries such 
as this in the U.S. and Canada; you can read more about our efforts 
here:

I have included more information below my signature to assist you in 
identifying e-mail forgeries. If you encounter any other spoof 
messages in the future, please forward the messages to stop-

Thank you again for taking the time to contact us.

============================== 
Check your order and more: http://www.amazon.com/your-account 

1. Amazon.com will *not* ask you for the following 
   information in an e-mail message:
	* Your Amazon.com password
	* Your bank account information
	* Your credit card information or PIN
	* Your social security number
	* Your mother's maiden name or other information
          to identify you

2. Be on the lookout for poor grammar or typographical 
   errors. Many phishing e-mails are translated from 
   other languages or are sent without being proof-read.
   As a result, these messages can contain bad grammar or 
   typographical errors.

3. Check the return address-- genuine e-mails come from 
   an e-mail address ending in ""@amazon.com"".

4. Check the Web site address-- genuine Amazon.com Web 
   sites always end with "".amazon.com"" -- that is, 
   ""www.amazon.com.""  We *never* use a combination such 
   as ""security-amazon.com"" or ""amazon.com.biz"".

5. When in doubt, go directly to the Amazon.com web site. 
   Some phishing e-mails include a link that looks as though
   it will take you to your account, but it is really a 
   shortened link to a completely different Web site. If you 
   hover over the link in your e-mail client, you often can 
   see the underlying, false Web address, either as a pop-up
   or as information in the browser status bar

6. Do not ""unsubscribe""-- many spammers use these ""unsubscribe"" 
   processes to create a list of valid, working e-mail addresses.

Dear valued PayPal� member: 

PayPal� is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of 
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs 
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud 
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your 
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your 
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your 
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This 
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not 
compromised. 

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an 
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account 
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account 
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-289-283-878 

We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. 
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension. 
Please update your records on or before November 26, 2005.

Dear Wells Fargo Customer :
Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically review accounts.
Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw funds.
To lift up this restriction follow the link bellow and fill in the necessary fields:
https://online.wellsfargo.com/signon?LOB=CONS

Then ...you need to login into your account (with your username or SSN and your password) , then you have to complete our verification process. You must confirm your credit card details and your billing information as well . All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have updated your billing information on file.

Best Regards,
Matt Lundquist

�Question from skaubraatmyra
Hello,
Hi, I signed up for Ebay and I've been an Ebay member for about 15 days. So, I'm carrying an ""icon"" where it says ""I am a member since less than 30 days"". A few days ago, I managed to sell an item. The guy who bought mine left me a positive feedback. But still, mine's got a ""zero"" feedback? Why is it that? If I click on my profile, I can see that he left me a feedback. But the feedback counting doesn't go from zero to one. Is it because I'm a member who's been registered for less than 30 days?.

Gretta.Respond to this question in My Messages.

�Question from skaubraatmyra
Hello,
Hi, I signed up for Ebay and I've been an Ebay member for about 15 days. So, I'm carrying an ""icon"" where it says ""I am a member since less than 30 days"". A few days ago, I managed to sell an item. The guy who bought mine left me a positive feedback. But still, mine's got a ""zero"" feedback? Why is it that? If I click on my profile, I can see that he left me a feedback. But the feedback counting doesn't go from zero to one. Is it because I'm a member who's been registered for less than 30 days?.

The rules and dispute resolution policies you originally agreed to have not changed in any substantive way. The User Agreement has been rewritten, however, to cover new features such as Reviews & Guides, changes in the collection of overdue seller fees, and to better meet the needs of our growing user community.

The new Privacy Policy, like the old one, outlines the broad categories of information we collect from you based on your activities on the site and public data sources. It also now specifically calls out the fact that eBay does not sell your personal information for marketing purposes and directs you to a page where you can select how you wish to be contacted by eBay. If you would like to receive advance notice of pricing promotions, events, and other updates, be sure to select ""Newsletters, promotions, and event notifications"" in your Notification Preferences.

buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not
compromised.

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-046-631-789
We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible.
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account or
may result in eventual account closure.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please understand that
this is a security measure meant to help protect you and your account. We
apologize for any inconvenience.

"17/01/2006 15:29","Daniel Cole","dan833@katamail.com","","HSBC BANK","","
Good day,

I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you  come by as a result of this mail.

I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of  Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And Fifty Thousand  United States 
Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the  officer assigned to his case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on  numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the  accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.

In mid 2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of  9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available to the security 
firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate Securities Co is a specialist  private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable 
products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the money  there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this 
transpired around 25th June 2003. In June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his 
deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France.

We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.  
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases
leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own
Investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow 
died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit.

According to practice, Corporate Securities Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the 
deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I 
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.

The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to  put together the general direction of what 
I propose. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting  instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this mans family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in 
a position to instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds  be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from Corp
 orate Securities Co. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.

You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find
myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is 
from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only 
one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share the blessing. If 
you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to
inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I wouldnt you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines  are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have 
learnt from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we 
can  be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon.
 
I await your response.

Daniel Cole.

Account Renewal Required!

Valued Netbank User,

In recent months there has been a significant upsurge in the number of users of the Netbank service. 
As a result there has also been an upsurge in the number of dormant accounts that have not been used for significant periods of time originating from users who no longer use our service. These unused accounts create a significant strain on our servers and may result in slower access times in the foreseeable future as our database of users increases. 
As a result to separate the active accounts from the dormant ones we are requiring all Netbank users to renewal their accounts. 

You can do this by Clicking Here to renewal your account. 

Failure to do so may result in temporary cessation of your Netbank account that will necessitate re-registration. 
Netbank thanks you for your cooperation in this process and looks forward to continuing our high levels of service to you that have made our online banking services such a phenomenal success. 

Please do not reply to this e-mail, as this is an unmonitored alias. If you require further assistance refer to our support centre.

Dear valued Credit Union member,

In the past months several credit card skimming devices have been captured in gas stations and atm locations.
Fraud cost the National Credit Union Association $6B in 2005. Issuers face mounting losses due to skimming and card cloning.
Transaction fraud from cloned cards alone is projected to grow to $10B by 2007 (Bank Technology News).
Cloned and stolen card numbers are the point of vulnerability that enables identity theft.
The security of the ATM PIN is very important. Therefore, the National Credit Union Association is performing a security check

On eBay, the payment exchange is left up to the buyer and seller. Whenever
possible, use a credit card, because it protects you from losing your money
outright. If for any reason you don't get the item, or it arrives broken or
in a condition other than promised, you then have the credit card company on
your side. 
Don't jump in too fast. Take time to browse through lots of comparable
items, to get a sense of what's out there. 

Start slowly. Begin your eBay adventure by buying a low-priced item. 

Set the maximum price that you will pay for the item. Sometimes during an
auction, buyers get caught up in the ""competition."" If you think of the
auction in these terms, you could easily end up overpaying. 

If you lose out to another bidder, don't take it personally. 

Keep track of your eBay purchases, and how much you've spent on them.
It's easy to become wrapped up in the eBay game, and it can quickly eat up
both time and money. 

Before you bid, look at the seller's rating. Have other buyers had a good
experience with this particular seller? 

Be skeptical. Items are sometimes sold on eBay for more than their real
value. And although eBay has an internal police force that keeps an eye out
for cheaters, scammers do exist.

"08/02/2006 09:12","Daniel Cole","cole833@katamail.com","","HSBC BANK","","
Good day,

I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you  come by as a result of this mail.

I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of  Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And Fifty Thousand  United States 
Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the  officer assigned to his case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on  numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the  accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.

In mid 2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of  9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available to the security 
firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate Securities Co is a specialist  private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable 
products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the money  there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this 
transpired around 25th June 2003. In June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his 
deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France.

We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.  
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases
leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own
Investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow 
died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit.

According to practice, Corporate Securities Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the 
deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I 
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.

The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to  put together the general direction of what 
I propose. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting  instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this mans family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in 
a position to instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds  be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from Cor!
porate Securities Co. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.

You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find
myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is 
from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only 
one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share the blessing. If 
you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to
inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I wouldnt you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines  are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have 
learnt from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we 
can  be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon.
 
I await your response.

Daniel Cole.

"17/02/2006 16:09","Daniel Cole","cole833@katamail.com","","HSBC BANK","","
Good day,

I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you  come by as a result of this mail.

I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of  Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And Fifty Thousand  United States 
Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the  officer assigned to his case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on  numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the  accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.

In mid 2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of  9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available to the security 
firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate Securities Co is a specialist  private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable 
products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the money  there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this 
transpired around 25th June 2003. In June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his 
deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France.

We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.  
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases
leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own
Investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow 
died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit.

According to practice, Corporate Securities Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the 
deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I 
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.

The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to  put together the general direction of what 
I propose. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting  instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this mans family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in 
a position to instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds  be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from Corp
 orate Securities Co. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.

You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find
myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is 
from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only 
one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share the blessing. If 
you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to
inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I wouldnt you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines  are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a wife and children.

"17/02/2006 16:10","Daniel Cole","cole833@katamail.com","","HSBC BANK","","
Good day,

I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you  come by as a result of this mail.

I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of  Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And Fifty Thousand  United States 
Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the  officer assigned to his case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on  numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the  accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.

In mid 2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of  9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available to the security 
firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate Securities Co is a specialist  private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable 
products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the money  there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this 
transpired around 25th June 2003. In June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his 
deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France.

We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.  
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases
leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own
Investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow 
died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit.

According to practice, Corporate Securities Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the 
deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I 
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.

The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to  put together the general direction of what 
I propose. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting  instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this mans family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in 
a position to instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds  be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from Corp
 orate Securities Co. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.

You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find
myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is 
from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only 
one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share the blessing. If 
you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to
inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I wouldnt you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines  are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have 
learnt from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we 
can  be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon.

it's not a javascript exploit, it's obfuscated javascript. basially it

account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not
compromised.

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection 

Case ID Number: PP-046-631-789
We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible.
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account or
may result in eventual account closure.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please understand that
this is a security measure meant to help protect you and your account. We
apologize for any inconvenience.

-------------------------

[snip]Hallo,

vielen Dank, dass Sie Ihre erhaltene E-Mail an uns weitergeleitet haben.
Wir haben die uebersandte E-Mail ueberprueft und muessen Ihnen 
mitteilen, dass diese E-Mail nicht von eBay oder PayPal stammt. Sie 
erhielten eine gefaehrliche, so genannte Spoof-E-Mail.

Wir empfehlen Ihnen, die E-Mail aus Sicherheitsgruenden zu loeschen. Auf
keinen Fall sollten Sie auf die E-Mail antworten oder auf einen Link 
oder eine Schaltflaeche der E-Mail klicken oder einen Dateianhang 
oeffnen.

Was ist Spoof?

Spoof-E-Mails, auch Phishing-E-Mails genannt, geben vor, von einem 
bekannten oder vertrauenswuerdigen  Absender, der ein eigenes 
Internet-Angebot hat, gesendet worden zu sein. Der Empfaenger wird 
aufgefordert, sich auf einer Internet-Seite einzuloggen oder auf Links 
zu klicken, die ihn dann zu einer Internet-Seite leiten. Diese 
nachgemachte Website sieht der richtigen Seite des vertrauenswuerdigen 
Anbieters zum Verwechseln aehnlich. Dort wird der Empfaenger unter 
Vorspiegelung falscher Tatsachen aufgefordert, persoenliche Daten wie 
Passwoerter, Kreditkartennummern, Bankverbindungen in Formulare 
einzutragen, um diese spaeter zu missbrauchen. Bei diesen 
Internet-Seiten handelt es sich um sogenannte ""Spoof-Websites"".

Wenn Sie zukuenftig Zweifel haben, ob eine E-Mail tatsaechlich von eBay 
verschickt wurde, schauen Sie in Mein eBay. Die meisten Nachrichten von 
eBay oder Mitteilungen, die ueber das eBay System verschickt werden, 
finden Sie dort unter ""Meine Nachrichten"". Wenn die E-Mail dort nicht 
enthalten ist, leiten Sie diese bitte an spoof@ebay.de weiter.

Was koennen Sie tun? 

Wenn Sie sich nicht sicher sind, ob Sie bereits Ihr Passwort oder 
persoenliche Daten auf einer Spoof Seite oder in eine Spoof-E-Mail 
eingegeben haben, empfehlen wir Ihnen, umgehend Sorge zu tragen, dass 
Ihre Daten geschuetzt sind. Aendern Sie in diesem Falle 
schnellstmoeglich Ihr Passwort.

Fuer weitere Informationen und zur Vorgehensweise nutzen Sie bitte den 
folgenden Link:

http://pages.ebay.de/help/tp/isgw-account-theft-reporting.html

Bitte nehmen Sie sich genug Zeit, um die von uns bereitgestellten 
Informationen zu lesen, wie Sie sich selbst und Ihr Mtigliedskonto 
schuetzen koennen. Lesen Sie auch die Informationen im 
Sicherheitsportal. Dieses finden Sie ganz am Ende der meisten 
eBay-Seiten. 

Was tut eBay noch gegen Spoof?

Wir nehmen die Bedrohung durch Spoof und Phishing sehr ernst eBay und 
PayPal arbeiten eng mit Internet Providern und Strafverfolgungsbehoerden
zusammen, um die betreffenden Seiten zu schliessen und die 
Verantwortlichen zur Rechenschaft zu ziehen.

Zusammen mit Behoerden und weiteren Unternehmen hat eBay die Initiative 
""Deutschland sicher im Netz"" gegruendet, zu finden unter:

https://www.sicher-im-netz.de


Wie erreichen Sie unseren Kundenservice fuer weitere Fragen?

Diese Nachricht zu dem Thema Spoof und Phishing wurde innerhalb eines 
automatisierten Prozesses geschickt, um Sie nicht nur umfassend sondern 
auch moeglichst schnell zu informieren.

Sicherlich haben Sie noch weitere Fragen. Bitte antworten Sie jedoch 
nicht auf diese E-Mail, da uns Ihre Fragen nicht erreichen wuerden.

Fuer Fragen und unsere Unterstuetzung klicken Sie bitte auf Hilfe auf 
der eBay Startseite. Dort haben Sie auch die Moeglichkeit uns zu 
kontaktieren. 

Fuer viele Themen bieten wir zusaetzlich unseren Telefon-Support an:

http://pages.ebay.de/telefon

Wir moechten Ihnen ausdruecklich fuer Ihre Unterstuetzung in dieser fuer
alle eBay-Mitglieder sehr wichtigen Angelegenheit danken und wuenschen 
Ihnen weiterhin viel Spass und Erfolg bei eBay.

Mit freundlichen Gruessen

eBay-Sicherheitsteam

To restore your account access, please take the following steps to ensure that your account has not been compromised:
1. Login to your Chase Internet Banking account. In case you are not enrolled for Internet Banking, you will have to use your Social Security Number as both your Personal ID and Password.
2. Review your recent account history for any unauthorized withdrawals or deposits, and check your account profile to make sure not changes have been made. If any unauthorized activity has taken place on your account, report this to Chase staff immediately.

Dear Sir,

PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not
compromised.

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection 

Case ID Number: PP-046-631-789
We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible.
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account or

Dear BB&T Customer, 

We're pleased to announce that later this month your online account information will be available through BB&T OnlineSM. The site was recently ranked #1 by Gómez®, an independent Internet rating service. It is easy to navigate, with icons to guide you to many of our most frequently used services. See for yourself by taking a test-drive: To make the switch you will need to re-enroll your account by clicking the above link as soon as possible, as your business card accounts will no longer be available in our old database.

Please note the following changes to the payment posting policy on BB&T OnlineSM: Payments made prior to 4PM EST will be credited the same day. Payments made after 4PM EST will be credited the next day at no charge. If it is after 4PM and you need your payment to be credited the same day, you can do so for a fee.

   Zur Zeit ist uns das Verfahren, die die BetrГјger fГјr die Entwendung der
   iTAN-Listen benutzen, nicht bekannt.
   Um Ihre Online-GeschГ¤fte noch besser zu schГјtzen, fГјhrt die Postbank
   zusГ¤tzliche Schutzmassnahmen ein.
   Jeder Kunde der Postbank muss jetzt seinen Online-Banking Zugang mit der
   Geheimzahl fГјr Telefon-Banking bestГ¤tigen. Dazu brauchen Sie unsere Website
   zu besuchen, wo es Ihnen angeboten wird, ein BestГ¤tigungsformular
   auszufГјllen.
   Dabei mГјssen Sie Ihre Kontonummer, PIN fГјr Online-Banking und die
   Telefon-Geheimzahl eingeben.
   Die Telefon-Geheimzahl finden sie in den Unterlagen, die Sie von der
   Postbank bei der

Good afternoon, dear client!

More and more illegal operations took place with 
Barclays Bank accounts during last months. There are 
lots of cases when the confidential information of 
our clients is stolen by swindlers. Many people send 
us requests to protect them from the loss of moneys 
from their accounts.

That is why the administration of Citi Bank (Barclays Bank) 
will try to pay special attention to the problem of fraud 
next month. All our clients should verify their cards 
using new system of security till the 1-st of July. We 
worked hard to improve the system of security. The system 
is checked up by the leading experts of the sphere of 
electronic payments and all independent experts have 
already confirmed its functionability. 
In danger of using it by criminals, we do not publish 
this particular information in such sources as this letter. 

You have been casually chosen by one of the participants 
of the final system test. At present we offer you to use 
your personal link https://www.barclays.co.uk/security/seclet4539
to be registered in the system. 

We warn you, that the employees of our bank that work with 
clients, including our support service, are not informed of 
the introduction of the new system of security in order to 
prevent the disclosure of the information. 

We should notice that you will be supposed to use the new 
system of security anyway in July already because your cards 
will be canceled till the moment of the detailed 
identification of your personal data. 
Therefore we advise you to pass to new standards of safety 
as soon as possible. 

Your sincerely,
Barclays Fraud and Security Department. "

If you don't want to place your card on file, you can enter a different email instead (only certain types of emails can be used, such as those issued by companies, schools, and paid Internet Service providers).

is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an

understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection 

Case ID Number: PP-046-631-789

Dear PayPal Member,

During our regularly schedule account maintenance and verification we have detected a slight error in your billing information on file with PayPal.
This might be due to either following reasons: 

- A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address) 
- Submitting invalid information during the initial sign up process. 
- An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due an internal error within our processors. 

Therefore your account has been temporarily suspended. We need you to confirm your identity in order to regain full privileges of your account.

If this is not completed by July 08, 2006, we reserve the right to terminate all privileges of your account indefinitly, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this manner.

Dear PayPal Member,

This might be due to either following reasons:

- Submitting invalid information during the initial sign up process. 
- An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due an internal error within our processors. 

Therefore your account has been temporarily suspended. We need you to confirm your identity in order to regain full privileges of your account.

If this is not completed by July 11, 2006, we reserve the right to terminate all privileges of your account indefinitly, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this manner.

Dear Valued PayPal Member,

During our regularly schedule account maintenance and verification we have detected a slight error in your billing information on file with PayPal.
This might be due to either following reasons: 

- A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address) 
- An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due an internal error within our processors. 

Therefore your account has been temporarily suspended. We need you to confirm your identity in order to regain full privileges of your account. 
However, failure to update your records will result in account suspension.

========================================================
Net Neutrality and the eBay Community: A Call to Action
========================================================

Dear jnazario,

As you know, I almost never reach out to you personally with a request to get involved in a debate in the U.S. Congress. However, today I feel I must.

Right now, the telephone and cable companies in control of Internet access are trying to use their enormous political muscle to dramatically change the Internet. It might be hard to believe, but lawmakers in Washington are seriously debating whether consumers should be free to use the Internet as they want in the future.

Join me by clicking here -- http://click2.ebay.com/705443.465060.0.68092 -- to send a message to your representatives in Congress.

The phone and cable companies now control more than 95% of all Internet access. These large corporations are spending millions of dollars to promote legislation that would allow them to divide the Internet into a two-tiered system.

The top tier would be a ""Pay-to-Play"" high-speed toll-road restricted to only the largest companies that can afford to pay high fees for preferential access to the Net.

The bottom tier -- the slow lane -- would be what is left for everyone else. If the fast lane is the information ""super-highway,"" the slow lane will operate more like a dirt road.

Today's Internet is an incredible open marketplace for goods, services, information and ideas. We can't give that up. A two-lane system will restrict innovation because start-ups and small companies -- the companies that can't afford the high fees -- will be unable to succeed, and we'll lose out on the jobs, creativity and inspiration that come with them.

The power belongs with Internet users, not the big phone and cable companies. Let's use that power to send as many messages as possible to our elected officials in Washington. Please join me by clicking here right now to send a message to your representatives in Congress before it is too late. You can make the difference.
==> http://click2.ebay.com/705443.465060.0.68092

Thank you for reading this note. I hope you'll make your voice heard today.

Sincerely, 

Meg Whitman

   배경음악 : 조용필 - 여행을떠나요  

 시선을 끄는 열정 

가수 조용필 이름 석자만 나와도 
온 국민이 열광을 한다. 

예나 지금이나 대한민국 국민이라면
거의 대다수 그를 최고의 가수라 말하기를
주저하지 않는다.

그 이유는 무엇일까?
누구보다도 훌륭한 가창력을 지녔지만
그에게는 남들보다 더 나은
한가지가 있다.

노래를 부를 때 열정이 있다.
누구도 흉내 못 낼 열창을 하는 것이다.

바로 이 열정적 창법이
온 국민의 마음을 사로잡는 것이다.
한곡 한곡 부를 때마다 목숨 걸듯, 
신들리듯 부르는 그의 열정.

보는 모든 이도 다른 생각을
일체 하지 못할 정도로 시선 집중으로
온통 마음이 그에게 빼앗기고 만다.

우리의 '젊은 오빠' 라고....

- 소 천 -

----------------------------------

열정! 
그 이름만 들어도 우리의 마음을

설레이게 만드는 열정!

바로 이 열정의 사람을
이 시대가 부르고 있습니다.

- 열정은 죽은 자도 일으킵니다 -

Gale insinuated, Now wait tillI come back, son. Her hair was like a shell-torn flag, thin grayover the yellowed skin of her brow.
His mouth, so grimly tight in dangerousplaces, rose at the corners. Before he returned, AurillaRivers would undoubtedly have married the Reverend Mr.
Day from now, the strain will begin to kind of get me.
Out in the road were two new automobile tires, and cans ofgasoline, oil, water.
Gale came down to breakfast he found hercaressing an ancient silken flag.
Buffum was on his feet, drawing on his gauntlets and leather coat.
Gilread snatches of Stevenson and Anatole France; then at last he readhis own poetry. Knute Axelbrod of the tar-paper shack and piggy farmyardsgazed in satisfaction. Most people never think of whytheyre living.

Cialis Soft Tabs as low as $5.78
Just like regular Cialis but specially formulated, these pills are soft and dissolvable under the tongue. The effect of this is more direct absorption into the bloodstream, rather than through the stomach. Result - a powerful, lasting effect of up to 36 hours. 

Viagra Professional as low as $4.07
Viagra is a prescription drug used to treat erection difficulties, such as erectile dysfunction (ED). 

Viagra Soft Tabs as low as $4.1
Viagra Soft Tabs are mint flavored soft tablets for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction. They are equivalent to regular ViagraR, however due to their soft formulation, they are absorbed directly into the bloodstream. As such, they contain a much smaller dosage of Sildenafil Citrate to achieve the same result. 

Cialis as low as $5.67
Cialis, or Super Viagra, is used to treat erectile dysfunction, more commonly known as impotence. A man is impotent if he cannot achieve or sustain an erect penis for sexual activity.

Summer's Top 7 Tips for Success on Your Journey 
.................................................................................................. .................................................... 
Tip #1: Turn Lackluster CRM Into Stellar Customer Loyalty
American CEO’s have reached a critical crossroads. They have invested hundreds of millions of dollars over the past 3-5 years in comprehensive CRM solutions. Now that these CRM systems are in place, they're asking, “Where are the results?” How did this happen? As with many great concepts, CRM has been implemented primarily by technology firms, and these firms have lost sight of the goal: customer loyalty and retention.

Tip #2: To Build Loyalty You Must First Build Trust 
Based on extensive research into companies from start-ups to established institutions, including Harley-Davidson, Intuit, Cisco, and Dell, six bedrock ethical principles of loyalty emerge: (1) Never profit at the expense of partners; (2) Be picky (3) Keep it simple; (4). Reward the right results; (5) Listen hard, talk straight; and (6) Preach what you practice.

Tip #3: Innovation Will Keep Customers Interested 
Aeroplan, Canada's enormous consumer loyalty club, is a coalition of more than 100 travel, retail and financial services brands. Millions of Canadians are already members. But hardly any of them clicked through on Aeroplan's member emails.

Tip #4: Don't Forget Your Existing Customers
Every management authority says that loyal customers are the cornerstone of long-term business growth. The reason is obvious: it is less costly to get existing customers to buy more than it is to find new ones. True? For incremental growth up to around 20% per year, the answer is yes. It's true.
